		All the functions that will be used in Lightning Components MUST have
		@AuraEnabled annotation at the top of the function signature.
		ex:
			@AuraEnabled
			public static void someFunction(Object parameter){}

		Also:
			- Methods must be static and marked public or global. Non-static methods aren’t supported.
			- If a method returns an object, instance methods that retrieve the value of the object’s instance field must be public.
			- Use unique names for client-side and server-side actions in a component. A JavaScript function (client-side action)
			  with the same name as an Apex method (server-side action ) can lead to hard-to-debug issues. In debug mode,
			  the framework logs a browser console warning about the clashing client-side and server-side action names.
